# A system to assist Semantic Web data editing

This system has been designed for assisting the editing of Semantic Web data (RDF).
It is composed of two applications 
 - Backend: Java application, defined with Springboot to expose services through a REST API.
 This app dialogs with the RDF database through SPARQL query thanks to the Jena library.
 - Frontend: Web application which proposes a user interface for the visualisation and editing of an RDF database.
 
A demonstration video of this tool is available online: https://videos.ahp-numerique.fr/videos/watch/47dff2dd-7f23-43e3-b559-33e36dce53da
